##### 3. About me:
---
    I'm here to start my journey in IT. I've started learning HTML/CSS/JS to become Front-end developer, but my aim is to become a full-stack developer, so I'm also interested in learning Python as back-end/ML languange. ML is important to me, because I need to create several neural networks as tasks at the university.
